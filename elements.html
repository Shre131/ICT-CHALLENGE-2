            An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and define content in that webpage. An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag <tag name>, close tag </tag name> and content inserted between them. 

                
                
                <h2>Main root:</h2>
                
                The HTML  element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element. 

                The html element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document. It has a start tag < html > and an end tag < /html >. 

Then, inside the < html > element there is a < body > element: The < body > element defines the document's body.
